Manual Scheduling
add nodeName: <name> in the pod.yaml while creating the pod. Already created pod can not be rescheduled on a new node using nodeName. we can create a Binding and then reschule
it on another node.
If schudeler is absent, pod will remain in the pending state

Taint is put on Node
Toleration is put on pods.

kubectl taint nodes node-name key=value:<taint-effect>

There are 3 types of taint-effects : 
1. NoSchedule - No new pods will be scheduled
2. PreferNoSchedule - Try to avoid placing a pod on the node but that is not guaranteed
3. NoExecute - No new pod will be placed on this node and existing pods on this node will be evicted if they do not tolerate the taint

Example: How to add taint
kubectl taint nodes node-name key=value:<taint-effect>
kubectl taint nodes node1 app=blue:NoSchedule

How to remove taint: Put minus
kubectl taint nodes node1 app=blue:NoSchedule-

In order for the pod to be able to placed on this node we have to make the pod tolerant by adding toleration.

apiVersion:
kind:
metadata:
spec:
  container:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx
  tolerantions:
  - key: "app"
    operator: "Equal"
    value: "blue"
    effect : "NoSchedule"

Note: Pod with toleration to node1 can also be placed on node2. Toleration does not tell pod to go and sit on which node. 
When you apply taint on the node, it gives power to the node to accept only those pods which have toleration. pod can very well go and sit on other node.
If you want a specific pod to be placed on a particular node only then this is achived through node affinity.

Master node has taint effect as NoSchedule applied.

kubectl describe node node01 | grep Taints

-------
Node Selector: To place pod on a particular node, we mention NodeSelector in pods' spec And add label to the node. This can be used when pod is to be placed on only one node.
If you want to provide choice, say, pods can be placed on node1 or node2 in that case node affinity is used.

kubectl label node nodename label-key=label=value

Node Affinity: used when you want to place a pod on a particular node or provide a list of nodes on which pod can be placed. It is configurued in the pod's spec.
requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoreDuringExecution
preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoreDuringExecution

kubectl label node node01 disktype=ssd

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx
spec:
  affinity:
    nodeAffinity:
      requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
        nodeSelectorTerms:
        - matchExpressions:
          - key: disktype
            operator: In
            values:
            - ssd   #Here you can add the list, which can help place the pod on the nodes having this label.          
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx
    imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent

-----------------

Resources:

1 CPU - 1 AWS vCPU, 1 Azure core
1G (Gigabyte) = 1,000,000,000 bytes
1M (Megabyte) = 1,000,000 bytes
1K (Kilobyte) = 1,000 bytes

1Gi (Gibibyte) = 1,073,741,824 bytes
1Mi (Mebibyte) = 1,048,576 bytes
1Ki (Kibibyte) = 1,024 bytes

By default pod has no limit to the resources. It can use as much cpu/memory as it wants.
If the limit exceeds:
In case of CPU : System throttles the cpu and doesn't allow pod to use CPU above it's limit
In case of memory : System allows pod to use memory above it's limit but if it occurs often then the pod gets terminated with an OOM error (Out of memory)

Cases for CPU:
1. No request, no limit
2. No request, limit ---- reuqest=limit
3. Request, limit
4. Request, no limit --- most ideal case

DaemonSets : These are the objects which help to keep copy of pod on all the nodes that is created and removes this pod when that node is deleted.
Eg : If suppose you add a node, then the pod associated with the DaemonSet will automatically be added on the new node also. DS can be used for adding monitoring related pods,
so that we don't have to install new pod separately on the new node.
DS can not be created using Imperative command, but deployment and daemonset definition files are same, we can edit the kind, name and replicas.

Static pods:
These pods are created by Kubelet without the intervention of kube-apiserver. Pod definition file is kept at a particular location in the worker node, kubelet checks this location
after every interval and creates the pod using the file. This pod can be modified/deleted only by modifying/deleting the definition file kept at this location.
Static pods are used to run Control plane components like etcd, apiserver and controller-manager pods. The files etcd.yaml, apiserver.yaml, controller-manager.yaml are stored at the location say. /etc/kubernetes/manifests
How to identify static pods? They have node name appended at the end of them.

-------------
Monitoring:
There is Metrics server native to kubernetes. We can also use Prometheus, Datadog, ELK stack, dynatrace, etc.

Logging:
kubectl logs -f <podname>

If there are multiple containers in a pods.
kubectl logs -f <podname> <conatiner-name>

---------------
Deployment:

kubectl rollout status deployment/<deployment name>
kubectl rollout history deployment/<deployment name>

----------
Commands and Args:

python app.py --color red ==== We can write this in below format in the dockerfile.
In this command '--color red' can be overwritten from the command line.

ENTRYPOINT ["python", "app.py"]  == command which can not be altered.
CMD ["--color", "red"] === command which can be altered from commandline

ENTRYPOINT corresponds to "command" in pod definition file.
CMD corresponds to "args" in pod definition file.
-------
Question: Observe 2 files and tell which command runs at the container startup?

controlplane ~/webapp-color-2 ➜  cat Dockerfile 
FROM python:3.6-alpine
RUN pip install flask
COPY . /opt/
EXPOSE 8080
WORKDIR /opt
ENTRYPOINT ["python", "app.py"]
CMD ["--color", "red"]

controlplane ~/webapp-color-2 ➜  cat webapp-color-pod.yaml 
apiVersion: v1 
kind: Pod 
metadata:
  name: webapp-green
  labels:
      name: webapp-green 
spec:
  containers:
  - name: simple-webapp
    image: kodekloud/webapp-color
    command: ["--color","green"]

ANSWER: --color green (command overwrites ENTRYPOINT and CMD)
NOTE: Basically, command and arg given in pod.yaml overwrites Dockerfile's entrypoint and cmd.
------------------------

controlplane ~/webapp-color-3 ➜  cat Dockerfile 
FROM python:3.6-alpine
RUN pip install flask
COPY . /opt/
EXPOSE 8080
WORKDIR /opt
ENTRYPOINT ["python", "app.py"]
CMD ["--color", "red"]

controlplane ~/webapp-color-3 ➜  cat webapp-color-pod-2.yaml

spec:
  containers:
  - name: simple-webapp
    image: kodekloud/webapp-color
    command: ["python", "app.py"]
    args: ["--color", "pink"]

ANSWER: python app.py --color pink (args overwrites CMD)
---------------------------------

Environment Variables:

3 Types: Plain key value, ConfigMaps, Secrets

Example of plain key value:
kubectl run <pod-name> -e APP_COLOR=pink

env:
 - name: APP_COLOR
   key: pink

Example of ConfigMap:

env:
- name: APP_COLOR   (This we can give same as key)
  valueFrom:
    configMapKeyRef:
      name: <configpath-name>
      key: APP_COLOR 	
OR

envFrom:
- configMapRef:
    name: <configmap-name>

Example of Secret:
env:
- name: APP_COLOR
  valueFrom:
    secretKeyRef:

ConfigMap is also used in Volumes:

volumes:
- name: app-config-volume
  configMap:
    name: app-config
----------------------------------
Create ConfigMaps:

kubectl create configmap <configmap-name> \
	--from-literal=<key>=<value>
Eg: 
kubectl create configmap <configmap-name> \
	--from-literal=app=web

kubectl create configmap <configmap-name> \
	--from-file=<file-path>
Eg:
kubectl create configmap <configmap-name> \
	--from-file=app_config.properties

-------------------
Secrets:

kubectl create secret generic <secret-name> --from-literal=DB_Password=password

kubectl create secret generic <secret-name> --from-file=<file-path>

kubectl create secret docker-registry secret-tiger-docker \
  --docker-email=tiger@acme.example \
  --docker-username=tiger \
  --docker-password=pass1234 \
  --docker-server=my-registry.example:5000

Use secret in pod: 

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: private-reg
spec:
  containers:
  - name: private-reg-container
    image: <your-private-image>
  imagePullSecrets:
  - name: regcred
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
 name: app-secret
data:
  DB_Host: mysql
  DB_Password: password
---

Above data cant be stored in plain text, we have to put the encoded data:
echo -n 'mysql' | base64
echo -n 'password' | base64

To decode them use:
echo -n 'mysql' | base64 --decode
echo -n 'password' | base64 --decode

Ways to provide secret:
1.
spec:
  containers:
  - envFrom:
      - secretRef:
	  name: <secret-name>

2. 
env:
  - name: DB_Password
    valueFrom:
      secretKeyRef:
        name: <secret-name>
        key: DB_Password
3.
volumes:
- name: app-secret-volume
  Secret:
    secretName: app-secret

Note: Secrets are not encrypted, they are encoded.
Do not check-in secrets to SCM along with the code.
Secrets are not encrypted in ETCD, we can enable encryption at rest.
Use thrid party secrets provider like AWS, Azure, etc

--------------------

Multi-container pods:  

In a multi-container pod, each container is expected to run a process that stays alive as long as the POD's lifecycle. 
For example in the multi-container pod that we talked about earlier that has a web application and logging agent, both the containers are expected to stay alive at all times.
If any of them fails, the POD restarts.

It has 3 design pattern.
1. Sidecar
Sidecar containers are the secondary containers that run along with the main application container within the same Pod. 
These containers are used to enhance or to extend the functionality of the primary app container by providing additional services, or functionality such as logging, monitoring, security, or data synchronization, without directly altering the primary application code.
They are active throughout the lifecycle of the pod and can be started and stopped independently of the main container.
2. Adapter
3. Ambassador
4. Ephemeral container
Sometimes it's necessary to inspect the state of an existing Pod, however, for example to troubleshoot a hard-to-reproduce bug. 
In these cases you can run an ephemeral container in an existing Pod to inspect its state and run arbitrary commands.

InitContainers: 

At times you may want to run a process that runs to completion in a container. 
For example a process that pulls a code or binary from a repository that will be used by the main web application. 
That is a task that will be run only  one time when the pod is first created. 
Or a process that waits  for an external service or database to be up before the actual application starts. That's where initContainers comes in.

When a POD is first created the initContainer is run, and the process in the initContainer must run to a completion before the real container hosting the application starts.
InitContainer gets terminated after the process is completed.
You can configure multiple such initContainers as well, like how we did for multi-containers pod. In that case each init container is run one at a time in sequential order.
If any of the initContainers fail to complete, Kubernetes restarts the Pod repeatedly until the Init Container succeeds.

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: myapp-pod
  labels:
    app: myapp
spec:
  containers:
  - name: myapp-container
    image: busybox:1.28
    command: ['sh', '-c', 'echo The app is running! && sleep 3600']
  initContainers:
  - name: init-myservice
    image: busybox:1.28
    command: ['sh', '-c', 'until nslookup myservice; do echo waiting for myservice; sleep 2; done;']
  - name: init-mydb
    image: busybox:1.28
    command: ['sh', '-c', 'until nslookup mydb; do echo waiting for mydb; sleep 2; done;']

-------------------
Types of probe

livenessProbe
Indicates whether the container is running. If the liveness probe fails, the kubelet kills the container, and the container is subjected to its restart policy.

readinessProbe
Indicates whether the container is ready to respond to requests.
If you'd like to start sending traffic to a Pod only when a probe succeeds, specify a readiness probe.

startupProbe
Indicates whether the application within the container is started. All other probes are disabled if a startup probe is provided, until it succeeds. If the startup probe fails, the kubelet kills the container, and the container is subjected to its restart policy.
-----------------------
Cluster maintanence:

kubectl drain node1 -- pods are deleted from node1 and re-created on other pods. In other words, pods are evicted from node1. 
                       When we do drain, it cordons the node. Pods which are part of the replicaset will be drained,
                       pods which are not part of the replicaset will not be drained, we will have to drain them forcefully. But once they get deleted, they will be deleted forever.
kubectl cordon node1 -- node1 is marked as unschedulable. If we do not want to scedule any pod on node01 then we do cordon
kubectl uncordon node1 -- node1 is maked as schedulable, new pods will be scheduled on this.

------------------------------------------------------------------
Cluster upgrade process:

You have to always upgrade one minor version. And we always upgrade controlplane/master node first.

apt-get upgrade -y kubeadm=1.12.0-00 (Assuming we are at v1.11)
kubeadm upgrade plan  --- gives info about the current cluster version, kubeadm version, target version.
                          kubeadm upgrades kube-apiserver, kube-scheduler,kube-controller-manager, kube-proxy, etcd, coredns.
                          kubelet we have to upgrade manually.
kubeadm upgrade apply <version>   --kubeadm upgrades kube-apiserver, kube-scheduler,kube-controller-manager, kube-proxy, etcd, coredns.
                                    kubelet we have to upgrade manually.

NOTE: After upgradation do, kubectl get nodes. It will still show the older version, that is because we have not upgraded kubelet yet.

To upgrade kubelet on controlplane/master node:
kubectl drain <node> --ignore-daemonsets
follow documentation to upgrade and then uncorden this node.

Upgrade Worker nodes: (Refer documentation)

1. kubectl drain node1  (it eveicts the pods and marks the node as cordened meaning unschedulable)
2. Follow documentation
3. kubectl uncordon node1
--------------------

Take backup of etcd:

1. kubectl get pods -n kube-system
2. describe the etcd pod, you will find the below details.
3. To take bakcup:
export ETCDCTL_API=3
etcdctl snapshot save --endpoints=127.0.0.1:2379 \
--cacert=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/ca.crt \
--cert=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/server.crt \
--key=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/server.key /opt/snapshot-pre-boot.db


Restore the etcd:

export ETCDCTL_API=3
etcdctl snapshot restore --data-dir /var/lib/etcd-from-backup /opt/snapshot-pre-boot.db (restore backup from /opt/snapshot-pre-boot.db to /var/lib/etcd-from-backup)

Now update the backed up location into manifests file /etc/kubernetets/manifests/etcd.yaml under volumes.name: etcd-data
It will take some time to  bring back the pods up

---------
current config : kubectl config view
current context: kubectl config current-context
No. of clusters: kubectl config get-clusters
which cluster : kubectl config get-context
Switch to cluster1: kubectl config use-context cluster1

when the etcd is external, we can ssh into the etcd server and run:	
ps -ef | grep etcd

ETCDCTL_API=3 etcdctl --endpoints=https://127.0.0.1:2379 --cacert=/etc/etcd/pki/ca.pem --cert=/etc/etcd/pki/etcd.pem --key=/etc/etcd/pki/etcd-key.pem member list

How many nodes are part of the ETCD cluster that etcd-server is a part of?
ETCDCTL_API=3 etcdctl \
  --endpoints=https://127.0.0.1:2379 \
  --cacert=/etc/etcd/pki/ca.pem \
  --cert=/etc/etcd/pki/etcd.pem \
  --key=/etc/etcd/pki/etcd-key.pem \
   member list

An ETCD backup for cluster2 is stored at /opt/cluster2.db. Use this snapshot file to carryout a restore on cluster2 to a new path /var/lib/etcd-data-new.

scp /opt/cluster2.db etcd-server:/root
ssh etcd-server
ETCDCTL_API=3 etcdctl --endpoints=https://127.0.0.1:2379 --cacert=/etc/etcd/pki/ca.pem --cert=/etc/etcd/pki/etcd.pem --key=/etc/etcd/pki/etcd-key.pem snapshot restore /root/cluster2.db --data-dir /var/lib/etcd-data-new
vi /etc/systemd/system/etcd.service
and add the new value for data-dir
chown -R etcd:etcd /var/lib/etcd-data-new
systemctl daemon-reload 
systemctl restart etcd

------------------------------------------------------------------

Security:

Tools to generate certificate: openssl, easyrsa, cfssl, etc

Steps:
1. Create key : openssl genrsa -out server.key 2048
2. Create CSR using above key
3. Create cert using CSR and and key
4. To check details of cert : openssl x509 -in /etc/kubernetes/pki/apiserver.crt -text -noout

If users want to have access then creds are used. But if k8s components (etcd, kube-apiserver, scheduler, control-manager) wants access 
to other components within the cluster then that authentication is done using tls certificates (ca.crt, server.crt and server.key) 
however, this same concept of tls cert can be used to proivde access to the user as well instead of creds. Let's see how.

Stpes 1: Create certificate.

1. User will create key and csr.
2. He will share the csr with the Admin. Admin will create CSR object (csr-object.yaml) using the csr provided by the user:

apiVersion: certificates.k8s.io/v1
kind: CertificateSigningRequest
metadata:
  name: akshay
spec:
  groups:
  - system:authenticated
  request: <paste base64 encoded csr>
  signerName: kubernetes.io/kube-apiserver-client
  usages:
  - client auth

kubectl get csr

3. He will then approve it: kubectl certificate approve <user-name>
(Whe the admin approves it, in the backgroud CA signs this certificate, this CA is present in the control-manager component).
4. After approving, the certificate is generated which is then share to the user.

Or

3/4. Get the csr signed from the ca.crt kept at the location /etc/kubernetes/pki/ca.crt

Step 2 : Add kubeconfig

kubectl config set-credentials myuser --client-key=myuser.key --client-certificate=myuser.crt --embed-certs=true
kubectl config set-context myuser --cluster=kubernetes --user=myuser

Step 3: Creare role and rolebinding

-------------------------

Check access:

kubectl auth can-i create pods

Check if a user has access:
kubectl auth can-i create pods --as <user>

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Service Account:

There are 2 types of accounts:
1. User (Account) for humans
2. Service Account for bots.

kubectl set serviceaccount deploy/web-dashboard dashboard-sa


If an app wants to access k8s cluster then we create service account. Assign required permissions using RBAC (role and rolebinding)
k create serviceaccount <sa-name>
This serviceaccount creates a token which is stored in the object called as secrets.
Now the app can use this token to get access to the cluster.

We create SA > SA creates token > token is stored as secret.

Now if this app is present in k8s itself then we don't have to export the secret we can instead mount this SA secret as volume in the app's pod.

Each namespace has its own deafult SA. Whenever we create a pod we don't explicitly mention any volume or secret but if you see the pods details:
you can see that a volume is automatically created having the secret of the default token of SA.
This token is mounted at /var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceacount in the pod.

However, with the v1.22 and onwards, creating SA does not create secret token. We have to create SA and then create token which is expirable. (Recommended)
If you want a token which does not expire then you should secret associated with the SA (Not-recommended)
---

Secret type used to store docker registry related creds is "docker-registry"

k create secret docker-registry:
Example:
kubectl create secret docker-registry private-reg-cred \
--docker-username=dock_user --docker-password=dock_password --docker-server=myprivateregistry.com:5000 --docker-email=dock_user@myprivateregistry.com

This secret is then used in deployment def file as imagePullSecrets

Execute command "whoami" in the pod:	
kubectl exec ubuntu-sleeper -- whoami

Storage:

Docker volumes
1. volume mount : Mounts data from the /var/lib/docker/volumes location to the container
Example: docker run -v data_volume:/var/lib/mysql msql ---> here data_volume has the default location as /var/lib/docker/volumes/data_volume on the host.
you can also create volume : docker create volume data_volume2 ---> this volume will get created under /var/lib/docker/volumes on the host.

2. bind mount : Mounts data from any location into the container.
Example: docker run -v /var/lib/mysql:/var/lib/mysql msql  ---> here are are mounting /var/lib/mysql from host to /var/lib/mysql in the container

Storage driver takes care of the storage and layered docker images - overlay, overlay2,aufs, etc

Volumes:

PV:
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
  name: pv-log
spec:
  persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy: Retain
  capacity:
    storage: 100Mi
  accessModes: 
    - ReadWriteMany
  hostPath:
    path: /pv/log
---
There are 3 types of PVs:
1. Retain : If PVC is deleted pv is retained but not made available for other pvcs.
2. Delete : If PVC is deleted. PV is also deleted.
3. Recycle : If PVC is deleted, PV is cleared and made available for other PVCs, but this is deprecated instead storage class is used.

We always deleted pvc first. If pvc gets stuck in terminating while deleted it means, this pvc is being used in the pod. 
Delete the pod and then see pvc must have gotten deleted. Note the status of the PV will be in 'Released' state
-----

PVC:

kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: claim-log-1
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteMany
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 50Mi

Note: For the PVC to bind to PV, their accessmode must match.
PVC 'claim-log-1' will get binded to pv 'pv-log'
--
Add PVC in pod:

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: webapp
spec:
  containers:
  - name: event-simulator
    image: kodekloud/event-simulator
    env:
    - name: LOG_HANDLERS
      value: file
    volumeMounts:
    - mountPath: /log
      name: log

  volumes:
  - name: log
    persistentVolumeClaim:
      claimName: claim-log-1

---

Storage Class:

We do not creates PVs and keep. Instead we create a SC which is like a template. Everytime a PVC is used, associated SC creates the Volume as per requirement.

---
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
kind: StorageClass
metadata:
  name: delayed-volume-sc
provisioner: kubernetes.io/no-provisioner
volumeBindingMode: WaitForFirstConsumer
--------------------------------

Access Modes:

RWO - ReadWriteOnce - volume can be mounted by singe node, multiple pods on that node can access (for read and write)
RWX - ReadWriteMany - volume can be mounted by multiple nodes, multiple pods can access (for read and write)
ROX - ReadOnlyMany - volume can be mounted by many nodes as read only
RWOP - ReadWriteOncePod - volume can be mounted as read-write by a single Pod. One pod across the whole cluster can read/write on it.
----------------------------

How to identify which resources can be created with imperative command?

kubectl api-resources
kubectl api-resources --namespaced

------------
Security context:
There are 2 ways in which we can define security context:
1. in spec which will apply on all the containers in the pod.
2. in spec.containers which will apply on the specific container
3. capabilities are set inside the container.

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: multi-pod
spec:
  securityContext:
    runAsUser: 1001   //all containers in this pod will have this user
  containers:
  -  image: ubuntu
     name: web
     command: ["sleep", "5000"]
     securityContext:
      runAsUser: 1002   // but this container overwrites above 1001 and this container will have 1002 user

  -  image: ubuntu
     name: sidecar
     command: ["sleep", "5000"]

--
capabilities are added on a container:

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: security-context-demo-4
spec:
  containers:
  - name: sec-ctx-4
    image: gcr.io/google-samples/hello-app:2.0
    securityContext:
      capabilities:
        add: ["NET_ADMIN", "SYS_TIME"]
------------
Network policy:

Ingress - incoming traffic
Egress - outgoing traffic
